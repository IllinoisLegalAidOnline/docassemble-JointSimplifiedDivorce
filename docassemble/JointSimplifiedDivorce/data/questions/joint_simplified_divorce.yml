id: e-signature
question: |
  Do you want to add your e-signature to your ${ form_name }?
subquestion: |
  This program can put “**/s/ ${users[0].name.full(middle='full')}**” where you would sign your name. The court will accept this as your signature.

  If you do not add your **{e-signature}** now, you must sign your paper forms before you file and deliver them.

  <div class="alert alert-info ilao-info" role="alert">
    <h6 class="alert-heading">What it means to sign your forms</h6>
    <p>By signing your <i>Petition for Divorce</i>, you are certifying that:</p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>Everything on the forms is true and correct, or you have been informed or you believe it is true and correct, and</li>
      <li>You understand that making a false statement on the form is perjury and has penalties provided by law.</li>
    </ul></p>
  <p>See the <a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/documents/073500050k1-109.htm"><b>Code of Civil Procedure, 735 ILCS 5/1-109</b></a> for more information.</p>
